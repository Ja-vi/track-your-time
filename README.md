track-your-time

I created this program because I was using worklog to track the time I used
in projects, and I wanted to make some changes to the code and increase
functionality, but the C code is too long for the given task.

I also would like to create an easier interface and persistence system, 
integrated with JSON or YAML in order to make the config file and logs look 
clean.

To execute it, run:

	python tyt.py
